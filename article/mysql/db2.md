DB21085I  此实例或安装（适用的实例名："DB2"）使用 "32" 位和级别标识为 "0602010E"
的 DB2 代码发行版 "SQL10051"。
参考标记为 "DB2 v10.5.100.64"、"special_31160" 和 "IP23520_31160"，修订包为

产品使用 DB2 副本名 "DB2SAYI" 安装在 "C:\IBM\SQLLIB" 中。

C:\IBM\SQLLIB\BIN>db2 list db directory
SQL1031N  在指示的文件系统中找不到数据库目录。  SQLSTATE=58031

实例层上常用的DB2命令
db2start  启动当前实例
db2stop  停止当前实例
db2 force applications all  关闭所有连接，确保没有连接
db2icrt  创建一个新的实例
db2idrop  删除一个实例
db2ilist  显示系统您当前的所有实例清单
db2 get instance  显示当前运行的实例

数据库层的命令/SQL 语句
db2 list db directory  显示所有已创建的数据库
db2 create database(db)  创建一个新的数据库
db2 drop database  删除一个数据库
db2 connect to <database_name> user [username] using [pwd] 连接数据库
db2 create table/create view/create index  分别创建表，视图，和索引

随着数据库的创建，有几个默认的对象也同时被创建：表空间，表，缓冲池，日志文件。因为
创建这些对象需要一点时间，所以执行数据库创建过程需要几分钟。

所有的 DB 数据库对象标识名都可以一分为二，模式就是此名字的前半部分。
<模式名>.<对象名> 
一个标识名称必须是独一无二的。在没有指定模式的情况下连接数据库并创建或引用数据库对
象时，DB2 使用用户 ID 作为模式名称来连接数据库


db2 list tables [for user] 列出所有用户表
db2 list tables for system  列出所有系统表
db2 describe table table_name  列出表结构
